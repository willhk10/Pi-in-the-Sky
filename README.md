# Planning
## Initial Ideas
  * Supersonic Potato Cannon
    * Pros - High altitude, powerful
    * Cons - Difficult to materialize, expensive, extremely dangerous, difficult to transfer
  * Hot Air Balloon
    * Pros - Floats for a long time, high altitude
    * Cons - Slow, hard to heat and contain air
  * Bottle Rocket
    * Pros - High altitude, lightweight, easy to construct, flexible
    * Cons - Maximum PSI limits potential height, mildly dangerous due to high pressure

## Final Design Plan
We decided to make a Bottle Rocket due to the inexpensive, easy construction, and the flexibility of the design. The maximum PSI will not limit the height drastically, and the path of the flight could be controlled by varying the pressure and angle at lauch.
